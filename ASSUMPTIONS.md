# ASSUMPTIONS

Decisions Claude Code made without asking, per `CLAUDE.md` section 6. The user reviews this file, not chat. Newest first.

Format:

```
## ASM-001 · <TASK-ID> · <date>
Question: <the ambiguity, one line>
Assumed: <the choice>
Why: <one line>
Cheap to reverse: yes | no

## ASM-004 · P0-T01 · 2026-08-25
Question: `attw --pack` fails on an ESM-only package because node10 resolution has no CJS entry.
Assumed: run it as `attw --pack --profile esm-only`.
Why: D-19 asks for ESM-only output; node10 resolution failure is the expected, correct result for that shape, not a defect to hide.
Cheap to reverse: yes

## ASM-003 · P0-T01 · 2026-08-25
Question: `pnpm gate all` in CI would be red for every phase not yet built.
Assumed: `gate all` runs the highest phase that has a `docs/execution/PHASE-N-REPORT.md`; with no report it runs the Gate 0 steps without the report requirement.
Why: a phase report is the signal that a phase shipped (docs/09), so CI verifies what has shipped and stays green during the build.
Cheap to reverse: yes

## ASM-002 · P0-T01 · 2026-08-25
Question: `eslint-plugin-boundaries` v7 classifies `@docs/*` and extensionless relative TS imports as unresolved, so the docs/02 section 2 rules never fire.
Assumed: add dev dependency `eslint-import-resolver-typescript` and point it at the root `tsconfig.json`.
Why: without a resolver the boundary rules are silently vacuous; verified by probe files that the rules now fail core→react and view→tree.
Cheap to reverse: yes

## ASM-001 · P0-T01 · 2026-08-25
Question: docs/11 section 1 pins TypeScript 5.x / Vite 7 / Vitest 3, but npm now ships TypeScript 7.0.2, Vite 8, Vitest 4, ESLint 10.
Assumed: follow docs/11 — TypeScript 5.9.3, Vite 7.3.6, Vitest 3.2.7, ESLint 9.39.5, with `--passWithNoTests` on the root `test` script.
Why: the pinned majors are a locked tooling contract; TypeScript 7 is the native port and would put tsup dts, typescript-eslint and the type-aware lint rules on unproven ground for no product gain.
Cheap to reverse: yes
