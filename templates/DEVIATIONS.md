# DEVIATIONS

Every departure from `docs/` gets an entry before the code lands. Newest first. Keep entries factual and short.

Format:

```
## DEV-001 · <TASK-ID> · <date>
Spec said: <doc and section, one line>
Reality: <what the installed library / platform / measurement actually offers>
Decision: <what was built instead; behavior preserved or not>
Impact: <public API, bundle size, tests, docs touched>
Reverse when: <condition under which the spec's version becomes possible>
```

Categories that always require an entry: new runtime dependency (with gz size and license), a dropped stretch block (D-17), a budget exceeded (with the breakdown), a locked decision that could not be implemented as written, a golden file change.
